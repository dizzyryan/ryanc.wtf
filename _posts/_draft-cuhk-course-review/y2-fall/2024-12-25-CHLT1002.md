### Review

Not much to say. The workload is normal (as mentioned above in the grading scheme). The course is a bit boring, but since attendance is part of the grade, you can only miss three lectures.

The material taught by the instructor was somewhat dull, and the advice given, in my opinion, was not particularly useful. That said, it doesn’t hurt to hear some "advice", I suppose.
