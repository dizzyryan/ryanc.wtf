Term Taken: 2024 Fall

Instructor: Mr. FUNG Ping Fu

### Grading Scheme
* Assignments: 35%
* Midterm: 25%
* Final Examination: 40%

### Textbook
Java Software Solutions: foundations of program design, 9th ed. John LEWIS and William LOFTUS, Addison Wesley/ Pearson, 2018.

### Review

This is just a standard course on Java. The only difference from the previous programming course, aside from syntax, is that this one focuses on Object-Oriented Programming — a concept that (at least I believe) is easy to learn.

The instructor has a funny teaching style, so there’s nothing to complain about. The workload is typical for a 3-credit course.

### Resource

This is the midterm exam I took. The code and solutions are provided in the Java files.
