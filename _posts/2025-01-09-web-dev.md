## Building Your Personal Site: A Simplified Guide  
This post is for those who want to create a personal site but find the process a bit challenging. <!--more-->

This site is built using [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), a Jekyll-based theme. I’ve tried several forks of this theme, such as [Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io), which are quite handy. However, I noticed that some functions were removed in these forks, making them less customizable. So, I downloaded the [original ZIP file](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/installation/) and figured it out myself.  

In this post, I’ll walk you through how I built my site, what changes I made, and how you can do it too. That said, exploring the forks I mentioned or figuring things out on your own is always a rewarding experience! Let’s dive in.

## Get Started  

### Option 1: Use My Template  
This is the easiest option since I’ve already done most of the work for you. Simply download and customize it to your liking!  

---

### Option 2: Start from Scratch  
I’ll provide a brief overview here. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Minimal Mistakes documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).  

You can always follow the [original version and guidance](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/), which works perfectly fine.

#### Steps:  
1. **Create a New GitHub Repository**  
  If you plan to use GitHub Pages to host your site, name your repository `<your-username>.github.io`. Clone the repository to your local computer.  

2. **Download the Minimal Mistakes Theme**  
  Clone or download the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Copy the following files into your repository:  
  - `_data`  
  - `_config.yml`  
  - `.gitignore`  
  - `index.html`  
  - `LICENSE` *(optional, for crediting the creator)*  
  - `Gemfile`  

---

#### Why These Files Are Important:  

1. **`_data`**  
  - `navigation.yml`: Use this to create links to the main pages of your site.  
  - `ui-text.yml`: Contains text automatically loaded during site generation.  

2. **`_config.yml`**  
  - The configuration file that controls the content displayed on your site. For details, check the [configuration guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/).  
  - If using a remote theme, update the theme-related lines as follows:  
    ```
    # theme                  : "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"
    remote_theme             : "mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.26.2"
    # minimal_mistakes_skin  : "default" # Options: "air", "aqua", "contrast", etc.
    ```  
    Make sure to check the latest version of the theme and update `@4.26.2` accordingly.  

3. **`.gitignore`**  
  - Specifies files to exclude when pushing to your repository.

### Final Thoughts  

You’re almost done! The rest is up to you to figure out. Building your site can be an exciting journey. Debugging might be frustrating at times, but the satisfaction of seeing your final product come to life makes it all worth it. Good luck, and happy coding!
